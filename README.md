# from mockup to website
this is my implementation of this [mockup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15VH4Mk8CvAh-pZMkgzGGVq-Wz1Nh3wJ8/view) using html and css,
I made sure it's responsive.
I also deployed it to github pages (check it [here](https://walid-hud.github.io/calm/)) to make it easier to test.
